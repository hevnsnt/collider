to be or not to be
i think therefore i am
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
all that glitters is not gold
a penny saved is a penny earned
the early bird catches the worm
actions speak louder than words
better late than never
birds of a feather flock together
curiosity killed the cat
don't count your chickens before they hatch
every cloud has a silver lining
fortune favors the bold
great minds think alike
ignorance is bliss
knowledge is power
let sleeping dogs lie
look before you leap
no pain no gain
once bitten twice shy
practice makes perfect
rome wasn't built in a day
the pen is mightier than the sword
time is money
when in rome do as the romans do
where there's a will there's a way
you can't judge a book by its cover
a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
ask not what your country can do for you
i have a dream
give me liberty or give me death
we hold these truths to be self evident
in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
let there be light
and god said let there be light
the lord is my shepherd
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
our father who art in heaven
for god so loved the world
i am the way the truth and the life
blessed are the meek
do unto others as you would have them do unto you
love thy neighbor as thyself
the truth shall set you free
in god we trust
one nation under god
e pluribus unum
with liberty and justice for all
may the force be with you
here's looking at you kid
frankly my dear i don't give a damn
i'll be back
you can't handle the truth
houston we have a problem
i see dead people
life is like a box of chocolates
show me the money
you talking to me
make my day
i'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse
there's no place like home

it was a dark and stormy night
call me ishmael
it is a truth universally acknowledged
happy families are all alike
all happy families are alike
it was the best of times it was the worst of times
all animals are equal but some are more equal than others
big brother is watching you
war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
four legs good two legs bad
the answer to life the universe and everything
don't panic
so long and thanks for all the fish
mostly harmless
winter is coming

what is dead may never die
the night is dark and full of terrors
a lannister always pays his debts
you know nothing jon snow
all men must die
not today
one ring to rule them all
my precious
you shall not pass
one does not simply walk into mordor
a wizard is never late
even the smallest person can change the course of the future
live long and prosper
beam me up scotty
resistance is futile
make it so
engage
to infinity and beyond
just keep swimming
hakuna matata
it means no worries
the circle of life

a whole new world
part of your world
under the sea
