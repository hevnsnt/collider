/**
 * CUDA Stub File
 *
 * This empty CUDA file forces CMake to treat the main executable as a CUDA target,
 * enabling proper device linking when using CUDA separable compilation.
 *
 * Without this, the linker fails with:
 *   unresolved external symbol __cudaRegisterLinkedBinary_*

// Empty - just needs to exist for CMake CUDA detection
